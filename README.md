# PIS2018 - Spotted Indigenous

Have a loook at the website [here!](https://borisflu.github.io/PIS2018/) (still in improvement)
<br>Or at the video demo [here]!

# Abstract 
The goal of this project is to build a tool that allows users to explore filtered tropical forest satellite images. 
<br>Already several platforms of “spatial archeology” exist, through which a user can spot culturally important ruins via high-resolution satellite images. 
<br>The contribution of this project is that the user will have the choice to do some guided exploration or verify data labeled by an algorithm. More precisely, the focus is on images containing (or not) Colombian indigenous houses. This way, the user will thus participate in improving an algorithm that could potentially detect global settlements from different tropical forests. 
<br>The model could be then used to precisely locate villages or network of houses and count them, finding its purpose in several domains such as ethnology or history. 
<br>The algorithm is based on transfer learning and a convolutional neural network. Trained on 1700 data, the accuracy on the validation set is close to 98%.

# Code documentation 
You can find the commented code for the front-end under the "docs" folder or have a look at the commented [notebooks](https://github.com/BorisFlu/PIS2018/tree/master/Notebooks) used to train the model (back-end part).
